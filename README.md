# GM, I’m Tarun – Crypto Native Dev & DeFi Chad 👋

Welcome to my corner of the blockchain! I’m a full-stack dev obsessed with building decentralized systems that empower users and flip traditional finance on its head. From smart contracts to omnichain protocols, I live for the grind of coding, deploying, and scaling Web3 solutions.  

Currently, I’m an SDE at [**Mercle**](https://github.com/Mercle), shipping cutting-edge tools for the decentralized future, and the Founder of [**ChadFinance**](https://github.com/ChadFinane) – a DEX and omnichain stablecoin protocol unlocking **$3B+ TVL**, letting LPs hedge impermanent loss (IL) like pros while stacking yields non-stop. Let’s make DeFi great again.

## 🛠️ My Web3 Arsenal

- **Languages**: Solidity (smart contracts are my jam), Python, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Frameworks**: Vue, React (UIs that slap), Hardhat, Foundry  
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, IPFS (decentralized storage ftw)  
- **Cloud & Infra**: AWS, Docker, Git, EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, Polygon, you name it)  
- **Crypto Stack**: Uniswap SDK, OpenZeppelin, Chainlink Oracles, ethers.js

## 🌐 What’s Cooking at ChadFinance?

- **DEX**: Low-slippage swaps with a UX that doesn’t suck.  
- **Omnichain Stablecoin**: Bridging liquidity across chains, making IL a relic of the past.  
- **Yield Farming**: LPs earn like it’s 2020, but smarter.  

**Visual Placeholder**: Imagine a line chart here showing ChadFinance TVL growth (e.g., $0 to $3B+ projection) or a pie chart of LP yield distribution. Want me to generate it? Just say yes!

## 📊 My Stats (On-Chain & Off)

- **Commits**: Pushing code like it’s gasless transactions.  
- **PRs Merged**: More than the average rug pull count.  
- **Chains Deployed On**: Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum – multichain is my vibe.  

**Visual Placeholder**: Picture a bar graph of commits/PRs over time or a heatmap of chain activity. Keen to add this? Let me know!

## ⚡ Fun Facts

- I’ve audited more Solidity code than I’ve had hot dinners.  
- My favorite opcode? `CALLDATALOAD` – efficiency is king.  
- HODLing knowledge > HODLing tokens.
